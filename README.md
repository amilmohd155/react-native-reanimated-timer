A Reanimated-powered library for creating smooth and customizable timers, stopwatches, and time displays in React Native. ‚è≥

## Features

Features

- üß© **Highly Composable** ‚Äì All components ‚Äî Timer, Stopwatch, and Clock ‚Äî are fully composable for complete flexibility.
- ‚ö° **High Performance** ‚Äì Achieves smooth 60 FPS animations powered by Reanimated.
- üé® **Fully Customizable** ‚Äì Configure behavior, appearance, and animations through flexible props.
- üéûÔ∏è **Built-in Entry & Exit Animations** ‚Äì Seamlessly integrate with Reanimated transitions.
- üß± **Powered by Reanimated** ‚Äì Built with Reanimated for smooth, performant, and reliable animations.
- üé® **Supports className Prop** ‚Äì Works with `NativeWind` for Tailwind-style styling, and optionally uses `tailwind-merge` for intelligent class merging.
- üöÄ **Expo-Compatible** ‚Äì Works out of the box with managed Expo projects.
- ‚ú® **TypeScript First** ‚Äì Fully typed for an enhanced developer experience and safer code.

## Components

- **Timer** ‚Äì Countdown timer with customizable duration, animations, and callbacks. [Check it out](#timer)
- **Stopwatch** ‚Äì Accurate stopwatch with start, pause, and reset controls. [Check it out](#stopwatch)
- **Digital Clock** ‚Äì Live clock display showing current time, updated in real-time. [Check it out](#clock)

## Composability

All components ‚Äî Timer, Stopwatch, and Clock ‚Äî are now fully composable.

They share a common set of time unit segments:
Day, Hour, Minute, Second, and Millisecond, AMPM.

This means you have full control over how time is displayed and animated.
You can mix and match these building blocks to create custom layouts, animations, and styles that fit your app perfectly.

Example

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@docren/react-native-reanimated-timer';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Timer durationMs={60000}>
      <Timer.Minute />
      <Timer.Second />
      <Timer.Millisecond />
    </Timer>

    <Stopwatch autoStart>
      <Stopwatch.Hour />
      <Stopwatch.Minute />
      <Stopwatch.Second />
    </Stopwatch>

    <Clock format="12">
      <Clock.Hour />
      <Clock.Minute />
      <Clock.Second />
      <Clock.Millisecond />
      <Clock.AMPM />
    </Clock>
  );
}

```

#### Why Composability?

This design enables:

- üß± Maximum Flexibility ‚Äì Use only the units you need (Minute, Second, etc.).
- üé® Full Customization ‚Äì Add your own separators, labels, or styles between units.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Consistency ‚Äì All unit components share a consistent API across Timer, Stopwatch, and Clock.
- üîÑ Interchangeability ‚Äì Swap components easily without changing the surrounding layout or logic.

Each component (Timer, Stopwatch, Clock) manages its own internal timing logic while exposing shared subcomponents for complete composability and freedom of use.

## Acknowledgements

- üôè **Component and Animation Inspiration**  
  This library is heavily inspired by [`react-native-animated-stopwatch-timer`](https://github.com/rgommezz/react-native-animated-stopwatch-timer) and the accompanying blog. It‚Äôs a great resource for understanding animation patterns with Reanimated‚Äîhighly recommended!

- üß† **Custom Hook Design**  
  The internal time management logic draws inspiration from [`react-timer-hook`](https://github.com/amrlabib/react-timer-hook). Chose not to use it as a direct dependency to allow for more fine-grained control and customization.  
  If you're only looking for a headless timekeeping hook (without UI), definitely consider using `react-timer-hook` directly.

### Installation

```sh
npm install @docren/react-native-reanimated-timer
```

> Note: This package is built on top of [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/), so make sure it‚Äôs properly installed and configured in your project.
> Refer to the [Reanimated installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started) if you haven‚Äôt already set it up.

#### Optional Peer Dependency

For better and more predictable class name merging, you can optionally install [tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) >= 3.0.0:

```sh
npm install tailwind-merge
```

> When twMerge={true}, the library uses tailwind-merge to intelligently combine class names.
> If tailwind-merge is not installed, it will gracefully fall back to the default behavior ‚Äî the nearest className wins.

## Segments

Each time unit is represented by an individual Segment component.
These can be freely composed to control what parts of the time are displayed.

- Day (not available for Clock)
- Hour
- Minute
- Second
- Millisecond
- AM/PM (available only for Clock)

| Prop           | Type      | Default   | Description                             |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| className      | string    | undefined | Styles the segment container            |
| style          | ViewStyle | undefined | Inline styles for the segment container |
| digitClassName | string    | undefined | Styles applied to the individual digits |
| digitStyle     | TextStyle | undefined | Inline styles for the individual digits |

> While each segment supports its own digitStyle and digitClassName, it‚Äôs generally recommended to define digitStyle at the root level. This ensures consistent styling across all segments for a unified look.
