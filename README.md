A Reanimated-powered library for creating smooth and customizable timers, stopwatches, and time displays in React Native. ‚è≥

![React Native Reanimated Chrono](./preview.gif)

## Features

- üß© **Highly Composible** - All components ‚Äî Timer, Stopwatch, and Clock ‚Äî are now fully composable.
- ‚ö° **High Performance** ‚Äì Achieves smooth 60FPS animations using Reanimated
- üé® **Fully Customizable** ‚Äì Configure behavior, appearance, and animations via flexible props
- üéûÔ∏è **Built-in Entry & Exit Animations** ‚Äì Seamlessly integrate with Reanimated transitions
- üß© **Powered by Reanimated v3** ‚Äì Utilizes the latest version for optimal performance and capabilities
- üé® Support Classnames
- üöÄ **Expo-Compatible** ‚Äì Works out of the box with managed Expo projects
- ‚ú® **TypeScript First**‚Äì Fully typed for better DX and safer code

## Components

- **Timer** ‚Äì Countdown timer with customizable duration, animations, and callbacks. [Check it out](#timer)
- **Stopwatch** ‚Äì Accurate stopwatch with start, pause, and reset controls. [Check it out](#stopwatch)
- **Digital Clock** ‚Äì Live clock display showing current time, updated in real-time. [Check it out](#clock)

## Composability

All components ‚Äî Timer, Stopwatch, and Clock ‚Äî are now fully composable.

They share a common set of time unit segments:
Day, Hour, Minute, Second, and Millisecond.

This means you have full control over how time is displayed and animated.
You can mix and match these building blocks to create custom layouts, animations, and styles that fit your app perfectly.

Example

```tsx
import { Timer } from '@doclabs/react-native-reanimated-timer';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Timer durationMs={60000}>
      <Timer.Minute />
      <Timer.Second />
      <Timer.Millisecond />
    </Timer>
  );
}
```

You can also use the same composable structure with the Stopwatch and Clock components:

```tsx
<Stopwatch autoStart>
  <Stopwatch.Hour />
  <Stopwatch.Minute />
  <Stopwatch.Second />
</Stopwatch>

<Clock format="12">
  <Clock.Hour />
  <Clock.Minute />
  <Clock.Second />
</Clock>
```

Why Composability?

This design enables:

- üß± Maximum Flexibility ‚Äì Use only the units you need (Minute, Second, etc.).
- üé® Full Customization ‚Äì Add your own separators, labels, or styles between units.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Consistency ‚Äì All unit components share a consistent API across Timer, Stopwatch, and Clock.
- üîÑ Interchangeability ‚Äì Swap components easily without changing the surrounding layout or logic.

Each component (Timer, Stopwatch, Clock) manages its own internal timing logic while exposing shared subcomponents for complete composability and freedom of use.

## Acknowledgements

- üôè **Component and Animation Inspiration**  
  This library is heavily inspired by [`react-native-animated-stopwatch-timer`](https://github.com/rgommezz/react-native-animated-stopwatch-timer) and the accompanying blog. It‚Äôs a great resource for understanding animation patterns with Reanimated‚Äîhighly recommended!

- üß† **Custom Hook Design**  
  The internal time management logic draws inspiration from [`react-timer-hook`](https://github.com/amrlabib/react-timer-hook). Chose not to use it as a direct dependency to allow for more fine-grained control and customization.  
  If you're only looking for a headless timekeeping hook (without UI), definitely consider using `react-timer-hook` directly.

### Installation

```sh
npm install @doclabs/react-native-reanimated-timer
```

> Note: This package is built on top of [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/), so make sure it‚Äôs properly installed and configured in your project.
> Refer to the [Reanimated installation guide](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/getting-started) if you haven‚Äôt already set it up.
